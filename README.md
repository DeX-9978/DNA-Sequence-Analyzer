# ðŸ§¬ DNA Sequence Analyzer

A beginner-friendly bioinformatics project written in Python that:
- Reads a DNA sequence from a FASTA-style `.txt` file
- Validates the DNA sequence
- Counts nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C)
- Calculates GC and AT content
- Visualizes nucleotide counts using a bar chart

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project was created as part of my journey to improve programming skills in Python and apply them to real-world bioinformatics tasks. The DNA Sequence Analyzer helps automate the process of reading and analyzing DNA sequences, a common task in genetic research. It includes essential bioinformatics operations such as validation, GC content calculation, and visualization â€” serving as a solid foundation for more advanced biological data processing.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Reads DNA sequences from a file
- âœ… Ignores FASTA headers (e.g., `>sequence`)
- âœ… Validates for only A, T, G, C characters
- âœ… Computes GC and AT content
- âœ… Plots nucleotide frequencies
- âœ… Generates the reverse complement struture of the DNA sequence
