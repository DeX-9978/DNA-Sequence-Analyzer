# ðŸ§¬ DNA Sequence Analyzer

A beginner-friendly bioinformatics project in Python that:
- Reads a DNA sequence from a FASTA-style `.txt` file
- Validates the DNA sequence
- Counts nucleotide frequencies (A, T, G, C)
- Calculates GC and AT content
- Visualizes nucleotide counts using a bar chart

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Reads DNA sequences from a file
- âœ… Ignores header lines (e.g., `>sequence`)
- âœ… Validates for only A, T, G, C characters
- âœ… Computes GC and AT content
- âœ… Plots nucleotide frequencies

## ðŸ“‚ Input Format

A `.txt` or `.fasta` file containing a DNA sequence:
```text
>Example DNA Sequence
ATGCGTACGTAGCTAGCTAGCTAGCTA
